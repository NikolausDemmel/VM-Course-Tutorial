These fife can not be macro instructions:

MARK (can't access FP/EP)
CALL (can't access FP/PC)
ENTER (can't set EP)
RETURN (can't set FP,EP)
SLINE n (we can't save S[SP] to S[SP-n] and then do n POP instructions, since
         we don't know the address SP-n)

Alloc can be:

ALLOC n = LOADC 0
          ... n - times ...
          LOADC 0
